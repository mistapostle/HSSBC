# HSSBC

This is a BlockChain toy for people who want to understand how Block chain works.

HSSBC = Happy Small Simple Block Chain  :) 

The goal is to make everything configurable. e.g., how to signature a transation, how Proof-of-work work   

Basic Structure
* BCSystem.kt - a configurable core of the whole system
* modle - basic models like Block , Transation etc 
* test - unit test , and also show how things works together

DONE:
* Basic chaining function
* POW
* Signing transation

TODO:
* Verify signature 
* RPC 
* Proof-of-Stake
* more
